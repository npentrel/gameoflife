## Optimization:

In an effort to reduce unnecessary computations, we only iterate over living cells and while doing so construct a dictionary to keep track of how often any neighbor of a living cell is accessed. These counts allow us to check which cells are to come alive in the next step. By comparing both implementations with two small tests we can see big improvements in this implementation as compared to the implementation as of `37d0abc`.

A further optimization effort could be to only recompute state in areas where change has occurred.
